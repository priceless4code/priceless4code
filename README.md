**Full-Stack Dev in Progress | JavaScript Wrangler | Jesus Lover | Meme Lord (Certified)**

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where code meets purpose and faith meets fire.

## Who Am I?

- A Microbiologist turned Developer (plot twist, right?)
- Currently diving deep into **JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**  
- Learning to build full-stack apps from the ground up (I like challenges. Bring it on.)
- Iâ€™ve already mastered HTML & CSS. JavaScript? Weâ€™re currently in a love-hate relationship.
- Iâ€™m building Christian-centered apps like the **Prayer Circle App** â€” faith + tech = boom!

## What Iâ€™m Working On
- **Prayer Circle App**: A web app for young Christians to share prayer requests, join live sessions, and build community.
- **Burning Hearts Ministries Website**: Clean, modern, and spirit-filled church site with live streams, giving features, and prayer forms.
- My own **personal portfolio site** with a touch of animation and fire design.

## Tech Stack I'm Exploring
```bash
ðŸ’» JavaScript | Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB | Git & GitHub | React (soon!)
ðŸŽ¨ HTML | CSS | Tailwind
